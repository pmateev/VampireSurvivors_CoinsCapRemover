**Coins Cap Remover** is a mod for **Vampire Survivors** that removes the in-game UI coin display limit and shows your actual gold count — even beyond the visible cap in the default UI.  
Perfect for high-gold runs where the counter normally stops updating.

---

## ✨ Features
- Displays **the true amount of gold coins** you have, without being cut off by the game's UI limit.
- Added **number delimiters** for easier readability.
- Toggable **real-time currency tracking** UI using **F1**.
- Toggable **currency formatting** using **F2**.

---

## ⚠ Limitations
- **Currently does not work with Adventures** mode in Vampire Survivors.
- UI beyond the cap is **display only** — does not alter game balance or actual gold values.

---
